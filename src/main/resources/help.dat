Input:
    Lambda:
        Use 'L' as lambda symbol.

    Bound:
        Bounds have to be written as one or more SingleBound(s) 'Lx.'
        or one MultiBound (short version) 'Lxy.'
        Lambda, variable(s) and dot have to be written together with no space in between.
        Multiple SingleBounds can have space in between e.g. "Lx.   Ly."
    Bound example:
        'Lx.'
        'Lx.Ly.'    |   don't mix both
        'Lxy.'      |   in a single term (see EBNF)

    Term:
        Terms exist of one or multiple SingleBound(s) or one MultiBound
        followed by Terms and/or Variables.
        Terms are always surrounded by round brackets.
    Term example (including inner terms):
        '(Lxy.xy)'
        '(Lab.a(Lbc.(La.a))ab)'
        '(Lxy.((Lyz.y)(Lpx.x)))'

    Variable:
        Allowed Variables are lower case a-z.


Output:
    Shows a list of steps to solve the input.
    Every step contains information on how to reach the next step.
    The result contains information 'end'.


Buttons:
    Start:
        Starts the calculation.
        Alternative: press 'Enter'

    Next:
        Shows the next step.

    End:
        Skips to the end / shows every step.
